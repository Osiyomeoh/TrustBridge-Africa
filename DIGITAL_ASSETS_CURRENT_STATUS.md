## 🔴 WHAT'S MISSING (15%)

### **1. Collections System - 0% ❌ CRITICAL**

**What's Needed:**
```
Collection Features:
├── Collection Creation
│   ├── Collection name, description, banner
│   ├── Assign NFTs to collection
│   └── Collection smart contract
├── Collection Pages
│   ├── Browse collections
│   ├── Collection detail page
│   ├── Filter NFTs by collection
│   └── Collection search
├── Collection Stats
│   ├── Floor price (lowest listed price)
│   ├── Total volume traded
│   ├── Item count
│   ├── Owner count
│   ├── 24h/7d/30d changes
│   └── Price charts
├── Collection Discovery
│   ├── Trending collections
│   ├── Top collections by volume
│   ├── Recently created
│   └── Verified badges
└── Collection Activity
    ├── Recent sales in collection
    ├── Recent listings
    └── Price floor changes
```

**Why Critical:**
- Users browse by collection, not individual NFTs
- Floor price is the #1 metric buyers care about
- Collections build community and brand
- Every major marketplace (OpenSea, Blur, Magic Eden) uses collections
- Without collections, discovery is very difficult

**Impact: HIGH** 🔴
**Effort: 2-3 days**

---

### **2. Royalties System - 30% ⚠️ CRITICAL**

**What Exists:**
- ✅ Royalty input field in asset creation (2.5% default)
- ✅ Royalty stored in IPFS metadata
- ✅ Royalty displayed on asset detail

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Smart contract royalty enforcement
- ❌ Automatic royalty distribution on sales
- ❌ Royalty payment tracking
- ❌ Creator royalty dashboard
- ❌ Royalty history/earnings display

**Implementation Needed:**
```solidity
// In marketplace smart contract:
function buyAsset(uint256 tokenId, uint256 serialNumber) public {
    // Get sale price
    uint256 salePrice = listings[tokenId][serialNumber].price;
    
    // Calculate fees
    uint256 platformFee = (salePrice * 250) / 10000; // 2.5%
    uint256 royaltyFee = (salePrice * royaltyPercentage) / 10000; // e.g. 5%
    uint256 sellerAmount = salePrice - platformFee - royaltyFee;
    
    // Distribute payments
    trustToken.transfer(platformWallet, platformFee);
    trustToken.transfer(originalCreator, royaltyFee); // <-- Need this
    trustToken.transfer(seller, sellerAmount);
}
```

**Why Critical:**
- Industry standard (5-10% royalties)
- Attracts creators to platform
- Sustainable creator economy
- Competitive necessity

**Impact: HIGH** 🔴
**Effort: 1-2 days**

---

### **3. Complete Offer Workflow - 60% ⚠️ HIGH**

**What's Missing:**
```
Offer Workflow:
├── View Offers (Seller Side)
│   ├── See all offers on owned assets
│   ├── Offer amount, offeror, timestamp
│   └── Sort/filter offers
├── Accept/Reject Offers
│   ├── Accept button → execute sale
│   ├── Reject button → remove offer
│   └── Transaction confirmation
├── Offer Management (Buyer Side)
│   ├── View my active offers
│   ├── Cancel offer
│   └── Edit offer amount
├── Notifications
│   ├── New offer received
│   ├── Offer accepted
│   ├── Offer rejected/expired
│   └── Counter offer received
└── Advanced Features
    ├── Offer expiration (24h, 7d, 30d)
    ├── Counter offers
    └── Bulk offer actions
```

**Why High Priority:**
- Users expect full negotiation capability
- Half-implemented features look unprofessional
- Offer system is key differentiator vs fixed-price only

**Impact: MEDIUM** 🟡
**Effort: 2-3 days**

---

### **4. Activity Feed - 0% ❌ HIGH**

**What's Needed:**
```
Activity Feed:
├── Global Activity

│   ├── Recent listings (price, seller)
│   ├── Recent offers made
│   └── Recent transfers
├── Asset Activity
│   ├── Sale history for specific asset
│   ├── Price history chart

**Impact: HIGH** 🔴
**Effort: 2-3 days**

---

### **5. Auctions - 0% ❌ MEDIUM**

**What's Needed:**
```
Auction System:
├── Auction Creation
│   ├── Set reserve price
│   ├── Set auction duration (1h, 24h, 7d, etc.)
│   ├── Set minimum bid increment
│   └── Choose auction type (English, Dutch)
├── Bidding Interface

│   ├── Bid history display
│   ├── Countdown timer
│   └── Outbid notifications
├── Auction End

└── Auction Discovery
    ├── Browse active auctions
    ├── Filter by ending soon
    └── Auction status indicators
```

**Why Medium Priority:**
- Drives engagement and competition
- Often yields higher prices than fixed
- Nice-to-have but not critical

**Impact: MEDIUM** 🟡
**Effort: 3-4 days**
