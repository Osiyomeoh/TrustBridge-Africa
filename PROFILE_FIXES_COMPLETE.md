# Profile Page Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Portfolio Value Showing Incorrect Amount (5K instead of real values)

**Problem:** Portfolio was calculating 1000 TRUST per asset (5 assets × 1000 = 5K)

**Root Causes:**
- Code was checking `metadata.totalValue` first, but assets use `metadata.price`
- Cache was persisting old values

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Changed price extraction order: `metadata.price || metadata.totalValue || metadata.value`
2. Enhanced Refresh button to clear cache before reloading
3. Added IPFS metadata fetching to get real prices

**Result:** Portfolio now shows accurate total based on real asset prices from IPFS

### 2. ✅ Listed Assets Disappearing from Profile

**Problem:** When user lists an asset, it transfers to marketplace and disappears from their profile

**Root Cause:** Profile only queried assets owned by user, not assets listed on marketplace

**Fix Applied:**
- Query BOTH user's wallet AND marketplace wallet
- Check transaction history to find which marketplace assets were listed by this user
- Combine owned + listed assets in profile

**New Flow:**
```
1. Query user's NFTs (0.0.6923405)
2. Query marketplace NFTs (0.0.6916959)
3. For each marketplace NFT:
   - Check transaction history
   - If transferred FROM user TO marketplace → User's listing
4. Show: Owned NFTs + Listed NFTs
```

**Result:** Listed assets now stay visible in profile with "Listed" status

## How It Works Now

### Asset Loading Process:

1. **Query Hedera Mirror Node**
   ```
   User NFTs: GET /api/v1/accounts/{userAddress}/nfts
   Marketplace NFTs: GET /api/v1/accounts/0.0.6916959/nfts
   ```

2. **Find User's Listings**
   - For each marketplace NFT, check transaction history
   - Identify listings: `sender = user && receiver = marketplace`

3. **Fetch IPFS Metadata**
   - Decode base64 metadata (IPFS CID)
   - Fetch from: `https://indigo-recent-clam-436.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/{CID}`
   - Extract: `name`, `price`, `image`

4. **Calculate Portfolio**
   - Sum all asset prices (owned + listed)
   - Display accurate total value

### Example Output:
```
✅ Found 3 NFTs owned by 0.0.6923405
🔍 Checking 10 marketplace NFTs for user's listings...
✅ Found listed asset: 0.0.7028555-1
✅ Found listed asset: 0.0.7025624-1
📊 Total: 3 owned + 2 listed = 5 assets

✅ Processed assets with real values:
  1. Art6: 19 TRUST (listed)
  2. Property: 150 TRUST (owned)
  3. Digital Art: 75 TRUST (listed)
  4. NFT #4: 100 TRUST (owned)
  5. NFT #5: 100 TRUST (owned)
💰 Total Portfolio Value: 444 TRUST
```
