## 📊 **Image Display Flow**

### **Asset Creation Process**
```
1. User selects image file
2. File gets uploaded to Pinata IPFS
3. Pinata returns IPFS URL: https://indigo-recent-clam-436.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/...
4. URL is stored in formData.imageURI
5. URL is passed to createDigitalAsset function
6. Asset is created with real image URI
```

### **Asset Viewing Process**
```
1. User navigates to asset view
2. Component fetches asset data
3. Real Pinata URL is used for image display
4. User sees their actual uploaded image
```
