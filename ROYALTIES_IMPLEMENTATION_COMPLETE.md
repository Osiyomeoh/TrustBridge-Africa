# ✅ Royalties System - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 What Was Built

### **Smart Contract V2 (100% Complete)**

#### **TRUSTMarketplaceV2.sol** - Enhanced with Royalty Support

**New Features:**
- ✅ `setRoyalty()` - Creators set royalty % (up to 10%)
- ✅ Automatic royalty calculation on every sale
- ✅ Automatic royalty distribution to original creator
- ✅ Royalty tracking per NFT
- ✅ Works with both instant buy AND offer acceptance

**How It Works:**
```solidity
// On every sale:
1. Calculate platform fee (2.5%)
2. Calculate royalty (e.g., 5%)
3. Seller gets: salePrice - platformFee - royalty
4. Creator gets: royalty
5. Platform gets: platformFee
```

**Key Functions:**
```solidity
setRoyalty(nftContract, tokenId, percentage) // Set royalty %
buyAsset(listingId) // Buy with auto-royalty
acceptOffer(listingId, buyer) // Accept offer with auto-royalty
getRoyaltyInfo(nftContract, tokenId) // View royalty settings
```

## 🚀 How Royalties Work (End-to-End)

### **Step 1: Creator Sets Royalty**
```typescript
// When creating NFT, creator sets royalty
await marketplace.setRoyalty(
  nftContract,      // "0.0.7028555"
  tokenId,          // "1"
  500               // 5% (in basis points)
);
```

### **Step 2: First Sale (Primary)**
- Creator sells NFT to Buyer A for 100 TRUST
- No royalty (creator is seller)
- Platform fee: 2.5 TRUST
- Creator gets: 97.5 TRUST

### **Step 3: Resale (Secondary)**
- Buyer A lists for 200 TRUST
- Buyer B purchases
- **Automatic calculations:**
  - Sale price: 200 TRUST
  - Platform fee (2.5%): 5 TRUST
  - Royalty (5%): 10 TRUST
  - Seller (Buyer A) gets: 185 TRUST
  - **Original creator gets: 10 TRUST** ✅

### **Step 4: Backend Tracking**
```typescript
// Automatically recorded
await royaltiesService.recordRoyaltyPayment({
  transactionId: "0.0.123@1234567890.123456789",
  nftContract: "0.0.7028555",
  tokenId: "1",
  salePrice: 200,
  royaltyAmount: 10,
  royaltyPercentage: 5,
  creator: "0.0.6923405",
  seller: "0.0.1111111",
  buyer: "0.0.2222222"
});
```

### **Step 5: Creator Dashboard**
Creator can now see:
- Total earnings: 10 TRUST
- Sales count: 1 secondary sale
- Monthly earnings: { "2025-10": 10 }
- Payment history with details
