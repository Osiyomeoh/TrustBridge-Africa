## 🔍 DEBUGGING

### Common Issues:

**"Transaction failed" when listing:**
```
→ Check NFT ownership
→ Ensure royalty % is 0-10%
→ Check wallet has HBAR for gas
→ Try reconnecting HashPack
```

**"Insufficient balance" when buying:**
```
→ Check TRUST token balance
→ Get more TRUST from /get-test-tokens
→ Check NFT is actually listed
```

**"Contract revert" errors:**
```
→ Check contract is not paused
→ Verify listing is still active
→ Ensure approvals went through
```

### Check Contract Status:
```bash
cd trustbridge-backend
node test-marketplace-v2.js
```

### Check Balances:
```javascript
// In browser console on your app:
await TrustTokenService.hybridGetTrustTokenBalance(accountId)
```

---

## 💰 GAS ECONOMICS

### Current Setup:
- ✅ **Users pay their own gas** (standard model)
- ✅ **Platform earns 2.5% TRUST** (revenue)
- ✅ **933 HBAR reserve** (for emergencies)
- ✅ **Self-sustaining** (infinite runway)

### Auto-Conversion (If Needed):
```bash
# Check gas status
cd trustbridge-backend
node scripts/auto-convert-trust-to-hbar.js

# Set up daily monitoring (optional)
crontab -e
0 0 * * * cd /path/to/trustbridge-backend && node scripts/auto-convert-trust-to-hbar.js
```

**Note:** Auto-conversion is **optional**. Your current model works without it!
