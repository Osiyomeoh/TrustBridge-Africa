## 👑 ROYALTY SYSTEM - THE GAME CHANGER

### How It Works:

```
Create NFT → Set Royalty (5%)
     ↓
List for Sale → Royalty stored on-chain
     ↓
Someone Buys → Smart Contract:
     ├─→ Creator: 5% (royalty) 👑
     ├─→ Platform: 2.5% (fee)
     └─→ Seller: 92.5%
     
Resell → Creator earns AGAIN! (forever!)
```

### Why It's Revolutionary:

✅ **Automatic:** No manual distribution needed
✅ **Perpetual:** Creator earns on EVERY resale
✅ **Trustless:** Enforced by smart contract
✅ **Transparent:** All on-chain and auditable
✅ **Fair:** Creator can't be bypassed

### Example:

```
Day 1: Create NFT, set 5% royalty
Day 2: Sell for 100 TRUST → Earn 97.5 TRUST
Day 7: Buyer resells for 150 TRUST → You earn 7.5 TRUST royalty
Day 30: New buyer resells for 200 TRUST → You earn 10 TRUST royalty
Day 90: Another resale for 300 TRUST → You earn 15 TRUST royalty

Total royalties: 32.5 TRUST (and counting!)
You keep earning FOREVER! 🎉
```

## 💰 ECONOMICS - SELF-SUSTAINING

### Revenue Streams:

1. **Platform Fees** (2.5% per sale)
   ```
   100 sales @ 100 TRUST avg = 2,500 TRUST revenue
   ```

2. **Premium Features** (Future)
   ```
   Verified badges: 100 TRUST
   Featured listings: 50 TRUST/week
   Collection verification: 500 TRUST
   ```

3. **Staking** (Future)
   ```
   Lock TRUST → Earn platform fees
   Provide liquidity → Earn rewards
   ```

### Cost Structure:

1. **Gas (HBAR):**
   ```
   Current: Users pay their own gas ✅
   Platform cost: 0 HBAR per transaction
   Reserve: 933 HBAR (lasts indefinitely)
   ```

2. **Infrastructure:**
   ```
   Backend hosting: ~$50/month
   IPFS (Pinata): ~$20/month
   Domain & CDN: ~$10/month
   Total: ~$80/month
   ```

3. **Break-Even:**
   ```
   Need to earn: $80/month
   Platform fee: 2.5% per sale
   
   If 1 TRUST = $0.01:
   Need: 8,000 TRUST/month
   = 320,000 TRUST in sales/month
   = ~100 sales @ 100 TRUST avg
   = ~3-4 sales per day
   
   EASILY ACHIEVABLE! ✅
   ```
