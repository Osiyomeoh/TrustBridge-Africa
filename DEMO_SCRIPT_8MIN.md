# TrustBridge Africa - 8 Minute Demo Script
**Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025 - Onchain Finance & RWA Track**

---

## 🎯 **Demo Goal**
**Demonstrate TrustBridge as a production-ready platform that democratizes access to African real-world assets via USSD + Hedera blockchain**

---

## ⏱️ **Time Breakdown**

### **0:00-1:00** | **Opening: The Problem**
**What you show:**
- Landing page (tbafrica.xyz)
- Mention: $1T in "dead capital" in Africa

**What you say:**
> "Africa holds $1 trillion in assets that can't be used as collateral, invested, or accessed by global markets. 65% of Africans are unbanked. 70% only have basic phones, no internet. Traditional banks exclude them. TrustBridge solves this by tokenizing real-world assets on Hedera blockchain - accessible via USSD (*384#) on any phone, no internet needed."

**Key Points:**
- 65% unbanked = 400M+ people excluded
- $350B in untradeable real estate
- $150B in unregistered agricultural land
- Traditional banks require credit history (excludes 65%)

**What you show:**

**What you say:**
> "Let me show you how a farmer with only a basic Nokia phone would tokenize their farm. They dial *384#, register in 30 seconds, and set a PIN. Our sponsor account covers all Hedera gas fees - they don't need crypto knowledge. They can tokenize farmland, real estate, commodities - all without a bank account, without internet, without crypto knowledge."
