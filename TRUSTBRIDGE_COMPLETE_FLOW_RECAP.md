## 🚨 **Critical Implementation Notes**

### **Wallet Strategy**
- **HashPack ONLY** - No MetaMask to avoid confusion
- **All transactions** go through HashPack popup
- **Error handling** for wallet connection issues

### **Transaction Patterns**
- **ALWAYS** use: `freezeWithSigner()` → `signTransaction()` → `execute()`
- **ALWAYS** set: `setMaxTransactionFee(1000)`
- **ALWAYS** get IDs from: `response.getReceipt(hederaClient)`

### **Data Storage**
- **Transactions**: Hedera network (immutable)
- **Files**: HFS (decentralized storage)
- **Events**: HCS (audit trail)
- **User data**: HFS (encrypted)

### **Compliance**
- **KYC required** for RWA creation
- **AMC approval** required for RWA trading
- **All events** logged in HCS for audit
- **Document storage** in HFS for verification
